# React Derived State Tests

My personal explorations of derived state on my way into concurrent React, imitating examples from documentation and posts I'm reading.

## Words of Caution

This repo is my own attempt to reproduce the differences in behavior described in React blog posts and update notes. Please start with those references rather than here.
- [Avoiding derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html)
- [React 16.3 update](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/03/29/react-v-16-3.html)

This is also part of my path to understanding concurrency in React, so [these links](https://github.com/sw-yx/fresh-concurrent-react) take priority above my examples, too.
